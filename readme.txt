This plugin redirects the main feed and optionally the comments feed to
Feedburner.com. It does this without the need to modify templates, setup new
hidden feeds, modify .htaccess files, or asking users to migrate to a new feed.
All existing feeds simply become Feedburner feeds seamlessly and transparently
for all users. Just tell the plugin what your Feedburner feed URL is and you're
done.
